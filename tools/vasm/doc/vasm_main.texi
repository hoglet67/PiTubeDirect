This chapter describes the module-independent part of the assembler. It
documents the options and extensions which are not specific to a certain
target, syntax or output driver. Be sure to also read the chapters on the
backend, syntax- and output-module you are using. They will
likely contain important additional information like data-representation
or additional options.

@node General Assembler Options
@section General Assembler Options

    @command{vasm} is run using the following syntax:

@example
      @command{vasm<target>_<syntax> [options] file}
@end example

    The following options are supported by the machine independent part
    of @command{vasm}:

@table @option

@item -chklabels
        Issues a warning when a label matches a mnemonic or directive name
        in either upper or lower case.

@item -D<name>[=expression]
        Defines a symbol with the name <name> and assigns the value of the
        expression when given. The assigned value defaults to 1 otherwise.

@item -depend=<type>
        Print all dependencies while assembling the source with the given
        options. No output is generated. <type> may be @option{list} for
        printing one file name in each new line, or @option{make} for printing
        a sequence of file names on a single line, suitable for Makefiles.
        When the output file name is given by @option{-o} then
        @command{vasm} will also print @code{outname:} in front of it.
        Note that unlike with @option{-dependall} only relative include
        file dependencies will be listed (which is the common case).

@item -dependall=<type>
        Prints dependencies in the same way as @option{-depend}, but
        will also print all include files with absolute paths.

@item -esc
        Enable escape character sequences. This will make vasm treat the
        escape character \ in string constants similar as in the C language.

@item -F<fmt>
        Use module <fmt> as output driver. See the chapter on output
        drivers for available formats and options.

@item -I<path>
        Define another include path. They are searched in the order of
        occurence on the command line.

@item -ignore-mult-inc
        When the same file is included multiple times with the same path
        this is silently ignored, causing the file to be processed only
        once. Note that you can still include the same file twice when
        using different paths to access it.

@item -L <listfile>
        Enables generation of a listing file and directs the output into
        the file <listfile>.

@item -Ll<lines>
        Set the number of lines per listing file page to <lines>.

@item -Lnf
        Do not emit any form feed code into the listing file, for starting
        a new page.

@item -Lns
        Do not include symbols in the listing file.

@item -maxerrors=<n>
        Defines the maximum number of errors to display before assembly
        is aborted. When <n> is 0 then there is no limit. Defaults to 5.

@item -maxmacrecurs=<n>
        Defines the maximum of number of recursions within a macro.
        Defaults to 1000.

@item -nocase
        Disables case-sensitivity for everything - identifiers, directives
        and instructions. Note that directives and instructions may already
        be case-insensitive by default in some modules.

@item -noesc
        No escape character sequences. This will make vasm treat the
        escape character \ as any other character. Might be useful for
        compatibility.

@item -noialign
        Perform no automatic alignment for instructions. Note that
        unaligned instructions make your code crash when executed!
        Only set when you know what you do!

@item -nosym
        Strips all local symbols from the output file and doesn't include
        any other symbols than those which are required for external
        linkage.

@item -nowarn=<n>
        Disable warning message <n>. <n> has to be the number of a valid
        warning message, otherwise an error is generated.

@item -o <ofile>
        Write the generated assembler output to <ofile> rather than
        @file{a.out}.

@item -pic
        Try to generate position independant code. Every relocation is
        flagged by an error message.

@item -quiet      
        Do not print the copyright notice and the final statistics.

@item -unnamed-sections
        Sections are no longer distinguished by their name, but only by
        their attributes. This has the effect that when defining a second
        section with a different name but same attributes as a first one,
        it will switch to the first, instead of starting a new section.

@item -unsshift
        The shift-right operator (@code{>>}) treats the value to shift as
        unsigned, which has the effect that 0-bits are inserted on the
        left side. The number of bits in a value depend on the target
        address type (refer to the appropriate cpu module documentation).

@item -w
        Hide all warning messages.

@item -x
        Show an error message, when referencing an undefined symbol.
        The default behaviour is to declare this symbol as externally
        defined.

@end table

Note that while most options allow an argument without any separating blank,
some others require it (e.g. @option{-o} and @option{-L}).

@section Expressions

Standard expressions are usually evaluated by the main part of vasm
rather than by one of the modules (unless this is necessary).

All expressions evaluated by the frontend are calculated in terms
of target address values, i.e. the range depends on the backend.

The available operators include all those which are common in assembler as
well as in C expressions.

C like operators:
@itemize
@item Unary: @code{+ - ! ~}
@item Arithmetic: @code{+ - * / % << >>}
@item Bitwise: @code{& | ^}
@item Logical: @code{&& ||}
@item Comparative: @code{< > <= >= == !=}
@end itemize

Assembler like operators:
@itemize
@item Unary: @code{+ - ~}
@item Arithmetic: @code{+ - * / // << >>}
@item Bitwise: @code{& ! ~}
@item Comparative: @code{< > <= >= = <>}
@end itemize

Up to version 1.4b the operators had the same precedence and associativity as
in the C language. Newer versions have changed the operator priorities to
comply with the common assembler behaviour. The expression evaluation
priorities, from highest to lowest, are:

@enumerate 1
@item @code{+ - ! ~} (unary +/- sign, not, complement)
@item @code{<< >>} (shift left, shift right)
@item @code{&} (bitwise and)
@item @code{^ ~} (bitwise exclusive-or)
@item @code{| !} (bitwise inclusive-or)
@item @code{* / % //} (multiply, divide, modulo)
@item @code{+ -} (plus, minus)
@item @code{< > <= >=} (less, greater, less or equal, greater or equal)
@item @code{== != = <>} (equality, inequality)
@item @code{&&} (logical and)
@item @code{||} (logical or)
@end enumerate

Operands are integral values of the target address type. They can either be
specified as integer constants of different bases (see the documentation
on the syntax module to see how the base is specified) or character
constants. Character constants are introduced by @code{'} or @code{"}
and have to be terminated by the same character that started them.

Multiple characters are allowed and a constant is built according to the
endianess of the target.

When the @option{-esc} option was specified, or automatically enabled by
a syntax module, vasm interprets escape character sequences as in the
C language:

@table @code

@item \\
        Produces a single @code{\}.

@item \b
        The bell character.

@item \f
        Form feed.

@item \n
        Line feed.

@item \r
        Carriage return.

@item \t
        Tabulator.

@item \"
        Produces a single @code{"}.
    
@item \'
        Produces a single @code{'}.

@item \e
        Escape character (27).

@item \<octal-digits>
        One character with the code specified by the digits
        as octal value.

@item \x<hexadecimal-digits>
        One character with the code specified by the digits
        as hexadecimal value.

@item \X<hexadecimal-digits>
        Same as @code{\x}.

@end table

Note, that the default behaviour of vasm has changed since V1.7! Escape
sequence handling has been the default in older versions. This has been
changed to increase compatibility with other assemblers. Use @option{-esc}
to assemble sources with escape character sequences. It is still the
default in the @code{std} syntax module, though.

@section Symbols

You can define as many symbols as your available memory permits. A symbol
may have any length and can be of global or local scope. Internally, there
are three types of symbols:
@table @code
@item Expression
      These symbols are usually not visible outside the
      source, unless they are explicitely exported.
@item Label
      Labels are always addresses inside a program section. By
      default they have local scope for the linker.
@item Imported
      These symbols are externally defined and must be
      resolved by the linker.
@end table

Beginning with vasm V1.5c one expression symbol is always defined to allow
conditional assembly depending on the assembler being used: @code{__VASM}.
Its value depends on the selected cpu module. There may be other symbols which
are pre-defined by the syntax- or by the cpu module.

@section Include Files

Vasm supports include files and defining include paths. Whether this
functionality is available depends on the syntax module, which has to
provide the appropriate directives.

On startup vasm will define at least one default include path: the
current working directory, where the assembler program was launched from.
When the input file is loaded from a different directory, i.e. the input
file is a relative or absolute path and not a single file name, then the
path to the input file name will be added as another include path.

Include paths are searched in the following order:
@enumerate 1
@item Current work directory.
@item Paths specified by @option{-I} in the order of occurence on the
      command line.
@item Path to the input source file.
@item Paths specified by directives inside the source text (in the order
      of occurence).
@end enumerate

@section Macros

Macros are supported by vasm, but the directives for defining them have
to be implemented in the syntax module. The assembler core supports 9
macro arguments by default to be passed in the operand field,
which can be extended to any number by the syntax module.
They can be referenced inside the macro either by name (@code{\name}) or by
number (@code{\1} to @code{\9}), or both, depending on the syntax module.
Recursions and early exits are supported.

Refer to the selected syntax module for more details.

@section Structures

Vasm supports structures, but the directives for defining them
have to be implemented in the syntax module.

@section Conditional Assembly

Has to be provided completely by the syntax module.
