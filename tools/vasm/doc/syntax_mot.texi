This chapter describes the Motorola syntax module, mostly used for the
M68k and ColdFire families of CPUs, which is available with the extension
@code{mot}.

@section Legal

    This module is written in 2002-2017 by Frank Wille and
    is covered by the vasm copyright without modifications.

@section Additional options for this version
 
This syntax module provides the following additional options:
 
@table @option
 
@item -align
 Enables natural alignment for data (e.g. @code{dc.?}, @code{ds.?}) and
 offset directives (@code{rs.?}, @code{so.?}, @code{fo.?}).

@item -allmp
 Makes all 35 macro arguments available. Default is 9 (@code{\1} to
 @code{\9}). More arguments can be accessed through @code{\a} to
 @code{\z}) which may conflict with escape characters or named arguments,
 therefore they are not enabled by default.

@item -devpac
 Devpac-compatibility mode. Only directives known to Devpac are recognized.
@itemize @minus
  @item Enables natural alignment for data and structure offsets
        (see option @option{-align}).
  @item Predefines offset symbols @code{__RS}, @code{__SO} and @code{__FO} as
        @code{0}, which otherwise are undefined until first referenced.
  @item Disable escape codes handling in strings (see @option{-noesc}).
  @item Enable dots within identifiers (see @option{-ldots}).
  @item Up to 35 macro arguments.
  @item Do not use @code{NOP} instructions when aligning code.
@end itemize

@item -ldots
 Allow dots (@code{.}) within all identifiers.

@item -localu
 Local symbols are prefixed by @code{'_'} instead of @code{'.'}. For
 Devpac compatbility, which offers a similar option.

@item -phxass
 PhxAss-compatibilty mode. Only directives known to PhxAss are recognized.
 Enables the following features:
@itemize @minus
  @item @code{section <name>} starts a code section named @code{<name>}
        instead of a section which also has the type @code{<name>}.
  @item Enable escape codes handling in strings (see @option{-esc}).
  @item Macro names are treated as case-insensitive.
  @item Up to 35 macro arguments.
  @item Allow blanks in operands.
  @item Defines the symbol @code{_PHXASS_} with value 2 (to differentiate
        from the real PhxAss with value 1).
  @item When no output file name is given, construct it from the input name.
@end itemize

@item -spaces
 Allow blanks in operands.

@item -warncomm
 Warn about all lines, which have comments in the operand field, introduced
 by a blank character. For example in: @code{dc.w 1 + 2}.

@end table

@section General Syntax

Labels must either start at the first column of a line or need to be
terminated by a colon (@code{:}). In the first case the mnemonic
has to be separated from the label by whitespace (not required in any case,
e.g. with a @code{=} directive). Qualifiers are appended to the mnemonic,
separated by a dot (if the CPU-module supports qualifiers). The
operands are separated from the mnemonic by whitespace. Multiple
operands are separated by comma (@code{,}).

Local labels are preceded by '@code{.}' or terminated by '@code{$}'.
For the rest, any alphanumeric character including '@code{_}' is allowed.
Local labels are valid between two global label definitions.

Otherwise dots (@code{.}) are not allowed within a label by default, unless
the option @option{-ldots} or @option{-devpac} was specified. Even then,
labels ending on @code{.b}, @code{.w} or @code{.l} can't be defined.

It is possible to refer to any local symbol in the source by preceding its
name with the name of the last global symbol, which was defined before:
@code{global_name\local_name}. This is for PhxAss compatibility only,
and is no recommended style. Does not work in a macro, as it conflicts
with macro arguments.

Make sure that you don't define a label on the same line as a
directive for conditional assembly (if, else, endif)! This is not supported.

In this syntax module, the operand field must not contain any whitespace
characters, as long as the option @option{-spaces} was not specified.

Comments are introduced by the comment character @code{;} or @code{*}.
The rest of the line will be ignored. Also everything following the operand
field, separated by a whitespace, will be regarded as comment (unless
@option{-spaces}). Be careful with @code{*}, which is recognized as the
"current pc symbol" in any operand expression

Example:

@code{mylabel inst.q op1,op2,op3  ;comment}

In expressions, numbers starting with @code{$} are hexadecimal (e.g.
@code{$fb2c}). @code{%} introduces binary numbers (e.g. @code{%1100101}).
Numbers starting with @code{@@} are assumed to be octal numbers, e.g.
@code{@@237}. All numbers starting with a digit are decimal, e.g. 
@code{1239}.


@section Directives

      on the line, separated by comma, will be assigned the <offset> plus
      the size of the previous symbol. The size defaults to 2. Valid
      optional size extensions are: @code{.b}, @code{.w}, @code{.l},
      where @code{.l} results in a size of 4, the others 2.
      The <offset> argument defaults to 4, when not given.

@item <symbol> fequ.s <expression>
      Define a new program symbol with the name <symbol> and assign to it
      the floating point value of <expression>. Defining <symbol> twice

      Assigns the current value of the stack-frame offset counter to <label>.
      Afterwards the counter is decremented by the instruction's <size>
      multiplied by <expression>. Any valid M68k size extension is allowed
      for <size>: b, w, l, q, s, d, x, p.
      The offset counter can also be referenced directly under the name
      @code{__FO}.

@item idnt <name>
      Sets the file or module name in the generated object file to
      <name>, when the selected output module supports it. By default,
      the input filename passed on the command line is used.

      greater than zero or equal.

@item iflt <expression>
      Conditionally assemble the following lines if <expression> is
      less than zero.

@item ifle <expression>
      Conditionally assemble the following lines if <expression> is
      less than zero or equal.

      Conditionally assemble the following lines if <string1> does not
      match <string2>.

@item ifd <symbol>
      Conditionally assemble the following lines if <symbol> is defined.

@item ifnd <symbol>
      Conditionally assemble the following lines if <symbol> is undefined.

@item ifmacrod <macro>
      Conditionally assemble the following line if <macro> is defined.

@item ifmacrond <macro>
      Conditionally assemble the following line if <macro> is undefined.

@item incbin <file>[,<offset>[,<length>]]
      Inserts the binary contents of <file> into the object code at
      this position. When <offset> is specified, then the given number
      of bytes will be skipped at the beginning of the file. The optional
      <length> argument specifies the maximum number of bytes to be read
      from that file.
      The file will be searched first in the current
      directory, then in all paths defined by @option{-I} or @code{incdir}
      in the order of occurence.

@item incdir <path>
      Add another path to search for include files to the list of
      known paths. Paths defined with @option{-I} on the command line are
      searched first.

@item include <file>
      Include source text of <file> at this position. The include file
      will be searched first in the current directory, then in all
      paths defined by @option{-I} or @code{incdir} in the order of
      occurence.

@item inline
      Local labels in the following block are isolated from previous
      local labels and those after @code{einline}.

@item list
      The following lines will appear in the listing file, if it was
      requested.

@item llen <len>
      Set the line length in a listing file to a maximum of <len> characters.
      Currently without any effect.

@item macro <name>
      Defines a macro which can be referenced by <name>. The <name>
      may also appear at the left side of the @code{macro} directive,
      starting at the first column. Then the operand field is ignored.
      The macro definition is closed
      by an @code{endm} directive. When calling a macro you may pass
      up to 9 arguments, separated by comma. Those arguments are
      referenced within the macro context as @code{\1} to @code{\9}.
      Parameter @code{\0} is set to the macro's first qualifier
      (mnemonic extension), when given.
      In Devpac- and PhxAss-compatibility mode, or with option
      @option{-allmp}, up to 35 arguments are accepted,
      where argument 10-35 can be referenced by @code{\a} to @code{\z}.

      Special macro parameters:
@table @code
@item \@@
      Insert a unique id, useful for defining labels. Every macro call
      gets its own unique id.
@item \@@!
      Push the current unique id onto a global id stack, then insert it.
@item \@@?
      Push the current unique id below the top element of the global id
      stack, then insert it.
@item \@@@@
      Pull the top element from the global id stack and insert it. The
      macro's current unique id is not affected by this operation.
@item \#
      Insert the number of arguments that have been passed to this macro.
      Equivalent to the conents of @code{NARG}.
@item \?n
      Insert the length of the @code{n}'th macro argument.
@item \.
      Insert the argument which is selected by the current value of the
      @code{CARG} symbol (first argument, when @code{CARG} is @code{1}).
@item \+
      Works like @code{\.}, but increments the value of @code{CARG} after
      that.
@item \-
      Works like @code{\.}, but decrements the value of @code{CARG} after
      that.
@item \<symbolname>
      inserts the current decimal value of the absolute
      symbol @code{symbolname}.
@item \<$symbolname>
      inserts the current hexadecimal value of the absolute
      symbol @code{symbolname}, without leading @code{$}.
@end table

@item mexit
      Leave the current macro and continue with assembling the parent
      context. Note that this directive also resets the level of conditional
      assembly to a state before the macro was invoked (which means that
      it works as a 'break' command on all new @code{if} directives).

@item nolist
      The following lines will not be visible in a listing file.

@item nopage
      Never start a new page in the listing file.
      This implementation will only prevent emitting the formfeed code.

@item nref <symbol>[,<symbol>...]
      Flag <symbol> as externally defined, similar to @code{xref},
      but also indicate that references should be optimized to base-relative
      addressing modes, when possible. This directive is only present
      in PhxAss-compatibility mode.

@item odd
      Aligns to an odd address. Equivalent to @code{cnop 1,2}.

@item offset [<expression>]
      Switches to a special offset-section. The contents of such a section
      is not included in the output. Their labels may be referenced as
      absolute offset symbols. Can be used to define structure offsets.
      The optional <expression> gives the start offset for this section.
      When missing the last offset of the previous offset-section is used,
      or 0.

@item org <expression>
      Sets the base address for the subsequent code. Note that it is allowed
      to embed such an absolute ORG block into a section. Return into
      relocatable mode with any new section directive. Although in Devpac
      compatibility mode the previous section will stay absolute.

@item output <name>
      Sets the output file name to @code{<name>} when no output name was
      given on the command line. A special case for Devpac-compatibility
      is when @code{<name>} starts with a @code{'.'} and an output name was
      already given. Then the current output name gets @code{<name>}
      appended as an extension. When an extension already exists,
      then it is replaced.

@item page
      Start a new page in the listing file (not implemented).
      Make sure to start a new page when the maximum page length is reached.

@item plen <len>
      The the page length for a listing file to <len> lines.
      Currently ignored.

@item printt <string>[,<string>...]
      Prints <string> to stdout. Each additional string into a new line.
      Quotes are optional.

@item printv <expression>[,<expression>...]
      Evaluate <expression> and print it to stdout out in hexadecimal,
      decimal, ASCII and binary format.

@item public <symbol>[,<symbol>...]
      Flag <symbol> as an external symbol, which means that <symbol> is
      visible to all modules in the linking process. It may be either
      defined or undefined.

@item rem
      The assembler will ignore everything from encountering the @code{rem}
      directive until an @code{erem} directive was found.

@item rept <expression>
      Repeats the assembly of the block between @code{rept} and @code{endr}
      <expression> number of times. <expression> has to be positive.
      The internal symbol @code{REPTN} always holds the iteration counter
      of the inner repeat loop, starting with 0. @code{REPTN} is -1 outside
      of any repeat block.

@item rorg <expression>
      Sets the program counter <expression> bytes behind the start of the
      current section. The new program counter must not be smaller than the
      current one. The space will be padded with zeros.

@item <label> rs.<size> <expression>
      Works like the @code{so} directive, with the only difference that
      the offset symbol is named @code{__RS}.

@item rsreset
      Equivalent to @code{clrso}, but the symbol manipulated is @code{__RS}.

@item rsset
      Equivalent to @code{setso}, but the symbol manipulated is @code{__RS}.

@item section [<name>,]<sec_type>[,<mem_type>]
      Starts a new section named @code{<name>} or reactivates an old one.
      @code{<sec_type>} defines the section type and may be @code{code},
      @code{text} (same as @code{code}), @code{data} or @code{bss}.
      @code{<sec_type>} defaults to @code{code} in Phxass mode. Otherwise
      a single argument will start a section with the type and name of
      @code{<sec_type>}. When @code{<mem_type>} is given
      it defines a 32-bit memory attribute, which defines where to load
      the section.
      @code{<mem_type>} is either a numerical constant or one of the
      keywords @code{chip} (for Chip-RAM) or @code{fast} (for Fast-RAM).
      Optionally it is also possible to attach the suffix @code{_C}, @code{_F}
      or @code{_P} to the @code{<sec_type>} argument for defining the memory
      type.
      The memory attributes are currently only used in the hunk-format
      output module.

@item <symbol> set <expression>
      Create a new symbol with the name <symbol> and assign
      the value of <expression>. If <symbol> is already assigned, it will
      contain a new value from now on.

@item setfo <expression>
      Sets the stack-frame offset counter to <expresion>.
      See @code{fo} directive.

@item setso <expression>
      Sets the structure offset counter to <expresion>.
      See @code{so} directive.

@item <label> so.<size> <expression>
      Assigns the current value of the structure offset counter to <label>.
      Afterwards the counter is incremented by the instruction's <size>
      multiplied by <expression>. Any valid M68k size extension is allowed
      for <size>: b, w, l, q, s, d, x, p.
      The offset counter can also be referenced directly under the name
      @code{__SO}.

@item spc <lines>
      Output <lines> number of blank lines in the listing file.
      Currently without any effect.

@item text
      Equivalent to @code{section code,code}.

@item ttl <name>
      PhxAss syntax. Equivalent to @code{idnt <name>}.

@item <name> ttl
      Motorola syntax. Equivalent to @code{idnt <name>}.

@item weak <symbol>[,<symbol>...]
      Flag <symbol> as a weak symbol, which means that <symbol> is
      visible to all modules in the linking process and may be replaced
      by any global symbol with the same name.
      When a weak symbol remains undefined its value defaults to 0.

@item xdef <symbol>[,<symbol>...]
      Flag <symbol> as an global symbol, which means that
      <symbol> is visible to all modules in the linking process.
      See also @code{public}.

@item xref <symbol>[,<symbol>...]
      Flag <symbol> as externally defined, which means it has to
      be important from another module in the linking process.
      See also @code{public}.
